Setting up the Rules

Rules are placed in the config file in json format as follows:
	[
		{"fromPort":"7002","toPort":"88","toAddress":"localhost"}
	]
Seperate each new entry with a comma like so
	[
		{"fromPort":"7002","toPort":"88","toAddress":"localhost"},
		{"fromPort":"7002","toPort":"88","toAddress":"localhost"}
	]
There is no limit on rules, but there may be a performance hit if the amount of rules get excessive.
