To use this program ensure you have GCC installed (it'd be amazing if it wasnt)

About the Program

RPort is a simple, configurable port forwarder for Linux written in C. The only requirements
for the program are a linux system and gcc as well as IPTABLES installed.

To compile the program, navigate to the main directory and execute these commands in the terminal.
	gcc src/*.c -std=gnu11 -o RPort

And to execute type this command
	./RPort <ip of the computer running it>

The program will load any rules you have created and go. To restablish the rules, just restart the program.

===============================================================================
Setting up the Rules

Rules are placed in the config file in this format
	<src ip> <destination port> -> <destination ip> <destination port>
	192.0.0.1 50 192.0.0.2 51
There is no limit on the rules, but there will be performance losses if the rules get excessive.
The first pair is source to be routed and the second pair is where they will be routed.
